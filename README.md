# MazeEscape  
Maze Solver is a maze game programmed and developed by me for a C Programming Module in Asia Pacific University (APU). In the game, players will compete with a bot to find the shortest path from start to end. The program is capable of randomly generating maze using Depth First Search (DFS). The bot is implemented using Breadth First Search (BFS).
